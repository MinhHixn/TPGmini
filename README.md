Introducing TPGmini v2 – Smaller, Smarter, and More Creative
TPGmini v2 – Tiny. Smart. Yours. TPGmini v2 is a complete reinvention of my tiny AR companion.

 Now smaller, sleeker, and smarter, it carries a brand-new miniOS with a bold visual identity: Liquid Glass meets Glyph Matrix on a vibrant OLED display. With just one customizable button, TPGmini v2 turns simplicity into creativity. Click, hold, or customize your own interactions — from real-time transcription and AI assistance to capturing life with a mini camcorder experience. Built-in apps like Gemini, Live Transcription, and Camera are just the start. 


TPGmini v2 invites makers and dreamers to build their own apps, bringing personal ideas to life in a device that snaps onto any glasses or works standalone. This is not just a gadget. It’s a statement: wearables should adapt to you, not the other way around.
